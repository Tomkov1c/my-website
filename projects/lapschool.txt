    In my third year of high school, I constantly had to carry paper database diagrams to my class while using a laptop to take notes.
    Eventually, it became annoying to carry that specific piece of paper around, so I thought, "Why not just digitalize it?" And so I did.
    It occurred to me that other students may have the same problem.
    <br>
    This is the result. Lapschool is a place where you can find a variety of diagrams, tools, and more â€“ all digitalized and interactive
    on a computer so you won't have to carry anything with you to classes, just your laptop.
</p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p class="sectionProjectsProjectParagraph">
    Over the course of development, I'll port tools, charts, etc., and make them more interactive.
</p>
<h3>The Periodic Table</h3>
<p class="sectionProjectsProjectParagraph">
    This is currently the only ported "tool." It includes everything that a regular paper periodic table would have,
    but I added a new feature. You can click on an element, and the site will display additional information about that element.
    I am not a chemist, and all data is sourced from Wikipedia, so please report any mistakes you find.

<h4>Element Inspect</h4>
<p class="sectionProjectsProjectParagraph">
    This feature allows you to click on an element, and it will display additional information about the element.
    All elements are supported. Element data is sourced from Wikipedia and shortened/modified by ChatGPT (3.0).
    Report any mistakes you find.

<h4>Advanced Settings</h4>
<p class="sectionProjectsProjectParagraph">
    At the bottom of the screen is a button with additional features you can activate to make the use of the website easier.
    Settings are saved in the browser storage and will still be applied on page reload.

    Yes, I am using Linux. I use Fedora BTW ðŸ¤“.
    <br><br>
    Yes, this is GNOME web browser.
    I only use it for showcase purposes and not for personal use. Why for showcase?
    Because I think it looks better than Google Chrome in those screenshots. Why not for personal use?
    Because it doesn't have an extension that I really need; I'm just used to Chrome and don't really need to switch right now,
    and Epiphany (GNOME web browser) isn't available on Windows anyway so a big no for me.
