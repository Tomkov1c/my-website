                    <p class="sectionProjectsProjectParagraph">So in my 3rd year of highschool, I constantly had to carry
                        some paper database diagrams to my class. I used a laptop to take notes and after sometime it
                        became annoying to carry that one specific piece of paper around, so it thought "Why not just
                        digitize it?", so I did. It accrued to me that other students may have the same problem.
                        <br>
                        This is the result. Lapschool is just a place where you can find a lot of diagrams,tools and more 
                        digitalized and interactive on a computer so you wont have to carry anything with you to classes,
                        just your laptop.

                    <h2>The Periodic Table</h2>
                    <p class="sectionProjectsProjectParagraph">This is currently the only ported "tool". It has everything that
                        a regular paper periodic table would have but I added a new feature. You can click on the
                        element and the site will display some additional information about that element. I am not a chemist and all data is sourced
                        from Wikipedia, so please report any mistakes you find.

                        <br><br>Yes this is GNOME web browser.
                        I only use it for showcase purposes and not for personal use. Why for showcase?
                        Because I think it looks better than Google Chrome in those screenshots. Why not for personal use?
                        Because it doesn't have an extension that I really need; I'm just used to Chrome and don't really 
                        need to switch right now and Epiphny (GNOME web browser) isn't available on Windows anyway so a big no for me.
