                    <p class="sectionProjectsProjectParagraph">So in my 3rd year of highschool, I constatntly had to carry
                        some paper database idagrams to my class. I used a latop to take notes and after sometime it
                        became anoying to carry that one specific piece of paper around, so it thought "Why not just
                        digitize it?", so I did. It accured to me that other students may have the same problem.
                        <br>
                        This is the result. Lapschool is just a place where you can find a lot of diagrams,tools and more 
                        digitalized and interactible on a computer so you wont have to carry anything with you to classes,
                        just your laptop.

                        <br><br>Yes this is GNOME web browser.
                        I only use it for showcase purposes and not for personal use. Why for showcase?
                        Because I think it looks better than Google Chrome in those screenshots. Why not for personal use?
                        Because it doesnt have an extention that I realy need; I'm just used to Chrome and dont really 
                        need to switch right now and Epiphny (GNOME web browser) isn't avalible on Windows anyway so a big no for me.
