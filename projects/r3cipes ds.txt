    I bought a Nintendo 3DS a while ago and jailbroke it because I wanted to download and apply custom themes on the home screen.
    I stumbled upon a big app store full of 3DS apps with various functions. At the time, I was going to Malta for an internship,
    and my classmates picked me to be the cook in our apartment. I searched for recipe apps and found one that would be perfect.
    For some reason, I thought, "Why not make one for my 3DS?" I don't know what kind of protein powder I drank that day, but I'm
    making it just for fun.
